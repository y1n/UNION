Dear ***UNION*** Community,
In order to keep everything in check, we made a thoughtful set of rules that should be followed here. Please read them carefully before you begin your stay here.

• __**Rule 1: Community Manifesto**__
Community Manifesto applies here. Following should be considered as the extension and clarification to them.

• __**Rule 2: Be Respectful**__
Please be respectful to other members of the community. If someone is disrespectful to you please contact our administration instead of insulting back.

• __**Rule 3: General Language**__
Our general language outside multi-language channels is English. Please restrain from using other languages outside of corresponding channels. If there is no channel for your language but you feel like there are quite a few people willing to have such - please message the administration.

• __**Rule 4: No Leeching**__
Do not beg for an account, subscription, insider information, boost or anything of similar nature. If people refuse to fulfill your request - restrain from asking again, or use direct message.

• __**Rule 5: Advertising**__
We do not tolerate advertising of other services. Expressing your point of view, opinion on pros and cons of each platform is fine, but keep it non-intrusive.

• __**Rule 6: Channels**__
Use appropriate channels for things you post.

• __**Rule 7: Trading **__
We won't tolerate any trading conducted on our Discord. The only form allowed is giveaway, where the receiving party is not obliged to do anything.

• __**Rule 8: No illegal content **__
Any kind of illegal content, including, but not limited to cracking, hacking, or cheat distribution is not tolerated here. Posting it will lead to ban and such content deletion.

• __**Rule 9: No sourcing**__
We do not tolerate sourcing of any content which violates Discord Terms of Service. Keep in mind that we by no means endorse cheating in online games, so please refrain from posting links to any cheating software.
